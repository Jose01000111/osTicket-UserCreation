# osTicket-UserCreation

#### In this lab, I created and managed users within osTicket, successfully setting up ticket users like Karen (Finance Manager) and listing test tickets. While this didn’t advance my A+ test prep, it gave me hands-on experience with a real help desk ticketing system. Overall, using this free ticketing system was a positive experience and a great way to familiarize myself with IT support workflows.

## Step 7: Customize osTicket for IT Helpdesk Training
I configured ticket categories such as Hardware, Software, and Network to organize incoming requests effectively. I then set up SLAs to establish clear expectations for response and resolution times. I assigned user roles like Admin, Technician, and End User to create a realistic workflow environment. Finally, I began logging and resolving test tickets to simulate real IT helpdesk scenarios.

## Step 8: Secure the System
To secure the system, I configured firewall rules to restrict access only to trusted sources. I also installed an SSL certificate to ensure that all communications with the osTicket portal are encrypted and secure.

## Step 9: Simulate an IT Support Environment 
I used ChatGPT to generate mock ticket submissions to simulate IT support scenarios. Using the Admin Panel, I managed and resolved these tickets to practice real-world troubleshooting. I also reviewed ticket history to identify recurring issues and refine our support approach.
